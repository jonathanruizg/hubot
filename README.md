### **What does Wolf Hubot do?**
Wolf Hubot (HB) is bot that does a couple of very simple things: 

- **1**: Tells you if you should go to bed depending on your tiredness level 
- **2**: Tells you if it wants to play a game 
- **3**: Responds if you tell it your favorite vacation spot 
- **4**: Shares random wolf gifs


### **What are the commands?**

> My tiredness level is [Insert number 1-10], should I go to bed?
- WH will tell you if you should go to bed depending on the number you input

> Hi Wolf, let's play a game
- If you call WH by 'Wolf' he will suggest a game, if you call it something else it would respond with a question

> My favorite vacations spot is [Instert city]
- If you tell hubot your favorite vacation spot and it matches a city from an array of spots, it will tell you that it wants to visit, otherwise it will add it to its fav list

> Random wolf gif
- WH will select a random wolf gif from an array made up of 6 gif links from GIPHY


### **Unsolved Problems**
Based on an exercise in CODECADEMY, I tried to make the actual rock, paper, scissors game work but I was unable to do so.
